# **CS50P - Problem Set Solutions**

Welcome to the **CS50P** repository! This repository contains my solutions for all the problem sets (psets) from **CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python** course. Each problem set explores different topics, gradually advancing from basic programming concepts to more complex problem-solving techniques, including the final project.

## **How to Use This Repository**

To explore the solutions:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CS50P.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the directory of the respective problem set:
   ```bash
   cd CS50P/psetX
   ```
   Replace `psetX` with the problem set number you wish to explore.

3. Open the Python files to review the solutions.
